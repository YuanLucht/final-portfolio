                <p>My name is Yu'an Lucht, and I'm a passionate Communication and Multimedia Design student at the University of Applied Sciences of Amsterdam! In my free time, 
                I enjoy working out, riding my motorcycle, learning French, and designing. I am currently 22 years old and live in Flevoland.
                I have a great passion for learning new things and trying out different activities. I also have a soft spot for cats! I find my professional development very important and always strive to improve. <br> <br>
                Prior to my current profession, I completed a three-year degree in Multimedia Design at ROC Hilversum, graduating at niveau 4. In addition, I also took a two-year elective called MVI 
                (Media Vormgeving en ICT) during my time at VMBO. So, Iâ€™ve been working in design for about seven years now.
